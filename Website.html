            <h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
            <p>A frontend developer is responsible for building the visible parts of a website or web application that users interact with directly. They take designs and turn them into functional, responsive, and interactive user interfaces using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend developers ensure that a site looks good and performs well across different devices and screen sizes, often collaborating closely with UI/UX designers to bring the visual elements to life. They work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to streamline development and enhance user experience. Beyond aesthetics, frontend developers focus on optimizing performance, accessibility, and functionality, ensuring that users have a seamless, efficient experience when navigating a site or app. Their role is essential in bridging the gap between design and technical implementation, making sure that the user's journey is intuitive and enjoyable.</p>
